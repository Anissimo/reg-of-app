On remote repository delete the "gh-pages" branch. 

In you local repository run this command: npm run build 

git add dist -f 

git commit -m [your commit message here]

git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages 

if anyone has a quicker process please feel free to update this! but I found this the fastest way to push up to gh-pages.
